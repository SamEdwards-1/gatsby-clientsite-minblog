## Introducing Retriever

Retriever is our standalone, full-service recruiting offering for off-line, online and hybrid qualitative research, from IDIs to focus groups to ethnographies to panels, both B2B and B2C.  Retriever turbocharges our team of savvy, experienced recruiters with cutting-edge digital capabilities.  No matter how complex the specs, Retriever is simply faster and better than any other way to recruit.

## Approach: Sniff, Fetch. Treat

Sniff:  Based on a detailed, multi-dimensional profile of your target audience, we develop a bespoke recruitment plan, utilizing a panoply of digital tools to maximize precision. There is no wild-goose chase here.  This is the art and science of finding needles in haystacks.  We are unafraid to sniff anywhere, and we never, ever use “lists”.

Fetch:  Once found, potential participants must be screened.  In the past, this has typically been done by interviewers who have been motivated to work at warp speed to keep costs down to meet quotas.  Our approach is the inverse.  We develop fool=proof, cheat-proof, self-screening questionnaires that treat every prospect identically and are administered at prospects’ speed, not at interviewers’ speed.  As a result, we typically find a much larger pool of fully qualified pool of potential participants than is needed, so we can select the very best.

Treat:  Treat is both a noun and a verb.  The treat is the reward or incentive we use to motivate and thank participants for their effort.  Almost never does it adequately compensate people for their time.  So we are often very creative about what we offer as “the treat” to amplify its perceived value.  The way we treat people is the way we all want to be treated: as human beings who deserve respect. This is one aspect of recruiting that cannot be automated. And why, for example, there is always somebody at Retriever to speak to, live.
