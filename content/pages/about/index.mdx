**Hugh Duthie** has been an ad agency head of planning, brand strategist and market researcher for over 30 years, with experience in the USA, UK and Canada. Among his side hustles, Hugh has taught brand management at NYU and guest lectured on qualitative research best practices at Columbia University. One of his longstanding professional pet peeves was the inconsistency and unprofessionalism of recruiting until he decided to do something about it. Hugh is based in NYC.


**Jennifer Baird Wilson** has been around the marketing block – literally – having worked in advertising, market research and on the client-side, as a CPG brand manager, on both sides of the US-Canada border.  At Retriever, Jennifer has assembled a brilliant recruiting team and has trained them in the principles of sniff, fetch and treat. As a mother and pet-parent herself, Jennifer knows how to keep multiple balls in the air, all at the same time, setting a high standard for the team. Jennifer is based in Toronto.
