Research that
focuses on creative ideas
WALK THE DOG RESEARCH
We’re a research company that specializes in making ideas bigger and better.
 
Walk the Dog founders Chip Walker and Hugh Duthie bring energy, enthusiasm and life to ideas via the way we approach research.
The two of us are both veteran brand strategy practitioners. As former agency heads of planning, we learned to do research in “the trenches” for some of the world’s most iconic brands.
When you understand where ideas come from and how they turn into real-world execution — you do research differently.
When you are aware of how fragile baby ideas are — you understand the need to handle them with respect and sensitivity.
And when your agency’s work lives or dies by your research approach — you do it more effectively.
WHY WE DO IT
In our opinion there’s a lot wrong with how ideas get researched today — especially creative ideas:
•	It’s about “testing” or beauty contests rather than idea optimization.
•	It’s about what respondents like or don’t like. (How often have you had a moderator show an idea, and then say, “what do you think?”)
•	It’s done by researchers who don’t understand the creative process. They don’t know how to listen for ways to optimize or fix an idea.
•	It panders — either to creatives who are understandably defensive or to clients who are understandably cautious. When what’s needed is an apolitical voice that advocates for the idea.
•	It’s with the wrong respondents.
•	It’s done in the wrong setting.
•	It’s done at the wrong stage in the creative development process.
•	It uses the wrong stimuli.
•	It routinely kills great ideas — or worse, waters them down.
Great ideas have the power to make or break brands. And they deserve better. We’re about research that helps you get to great ideas from good ideas.

OUR SERVICES
Our core competencies encompass research across the entire planning cycle, from insight hunting to brand positioning research to concept development and creative evaluation research. The following are just some of the methodologies we routinely employ.
Focus Groups
We resist the cookie cutter, but harnessing the dynamic of groups is still a powerful learning tool. We love to take groups out of facilities and closer to where people interact with your brand in real life.
Online Quali-Quant
Increasingly, research done online is a brilliant way to get closer to people and meet them on their own time, in their own worlds, and to do it on a scale that provides some of the confidence of numbers.
Ethnographies
We are experts at entering people’s homes and workplaces and bringing their emotions and behaviors to life in ways that clients can make brand sense of.
One-On-Ones
One-on-Ones, dyads and triads – these are the most intimate of forms of research forums and we are experts at getting rich insights and not just “answers to questions”.
Shop-Alongs
Our shopalongs are like safaris – exciting, thorough, brilliantly executed and yet full of great surprises. Nothing turns us on like a shopping expedition with your customer.
Ideation
With a combined 50+ years of experience with the best-of-the-best, we have an unrivaled toolbox and a set of methodologies proven to make ideation and brainstorming productive and truly successful.
